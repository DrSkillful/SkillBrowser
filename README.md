## NEWS!!!!!

Skillbrowser is now coded in C# as of version 3 and can run on both 32x and 64x systems!!!

## What is skill browser?

SkillBrowser is a 100% bare-bones, secure browser! It's still in development and there are some features that need to be added!

## BEFORE INSTALLING (IMPORTANT!)

To run V3 you need .NET Framework v4.0. You can install it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net40

To run V2 you need python v3.7 (can't run on windows 7 and below). Install here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

## Useful to know stuff

1) To add a new tab, double click next to your current tab (v2 only)
2) Use _precise_ links in the url bar. For example, you don't write `google.com`. Instead, you write `https://google.com`(v2 only)
3) V3 doesn't have tabs, but it makes up for that in speed and low RAM usage
4) Use _links generally_ in V3 like `google.com` or `youtube.com` NOT `google` or `youtube`

## Source Code usage

Before you run SkillBrowser's source code, you need 2 Python libraries: `PyQt5` and `PyQtWebEngine`

```python
pip install PyQt5
```
```python
pip install PyQtWebEngine
```
## To-do list
- ~~Save cookies~~
- ~~Renovate homepage~~
